Goal: The experience we are trying to achive is an interactive, calming evironment where players are able to create music through interacting with various instruments and eventually through drawing  in the VE.

Controls: Press 'Space' to change between monoscopic and stereoscopic cameras. Press '[' to decrease the ipd and ']' to increase it.

Props / WOZ Instructions: A small fan on low power must be placed a few feet (5-6) directly in front of the user before they start the experience, the fan will not change locations as the player moves. This simulates slight wind. Near the end of the animation when the camera approaches the drum, the user should have a solid surface placed in front of them. This is so the user can hit the surface and feel as if they are actually hitting the drum.
